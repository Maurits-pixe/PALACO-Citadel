# PALACO ATELIER / LABORATORIUM — Citadel vertical slice v0.1

`la-foundation.v0.1.json` defines a reusable L.A. template sourced from `EVA-LA-001`, with a separate identity for each new Citadel. Its source status is DRAFT. The template preserves the constitutional kernel and ordered L.A. trajectory; design fields are limited to an allowlist. OR6IT is declared as the WORLD development ELIXER and only receives an entry contract for an independently verified official ACTIVE Citadel. No WORLD is created by this module.

`builder.mjs` provides the domain functions: create a draft, record the ten L.A. stages, customize permitted fields, register creative assets with hashes and renderer provenance, and construct a DRAFT proof manifest through `citadel-proof`. Run `node --test atelier/builder.test.mjs citadel-proof/proof.test.mjs`.

The currently implemented scope is a **local domain reference**, not a wizard or production platform. Caller supplied maker IDs, project IDs, official status, authority verification and export sequence are untrusted unless validated by a server. A deployed Atelier needs authenticated tenancy and project isolation, persisted append-only audit with concurrency control, safe rendering and asset scanning, durable sequence tracking, independent review, signing key enrollment and a separate activation service. The source Notion pages were not independently accessible in this session; this contract follows the supplied design brief and requires a canonical content review before activation.

Next UI milestone: guided New Citadel flow using this contract, isolated preview in the L.A. layout, accessible customization controls, and export download. WORLD and ELIXER builders follow after the Citadel path is integrated and verified. Generated assets remain `CREATIVE_ASSET`, never proof or authority.

## Begeleide wizard en RIO

`wizard.html` is de zichtbare New Citadel route, bereikbaar vanaf de Citadel homepage. RIO's local guide explains the current step and points out missing input. It cannot choose on behalf of the maker, verify evidence, grant a role, or activate a Citadel. The browser downloads a local DRAFT JSON concept. This download is **not** a signed manifest, verifiable package, official Citadel, or secure multi-user record. The server side Builder must validate this input and run `draftExport` with exact file bytes and durable export sequence before it can claim a proof package. Browser flow has a DOM contract test but has not received real browser visual QA in this run.
